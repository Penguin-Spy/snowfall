# Snowfall
> Crash-landed on an inhospitable frozen moon, you must protect your factory from the elements. With an atmosphere of nitrogen and seas of methane, progressing here will be different than anything you've done before. At least scans of the surface didn't detect any lifeforms...

**in alpha**, many things are subject to change!  
save files will **not** be backwards-compatable at this point.

general gameplay:
- capturing geothermal steam for mechanical power
- new ores and alloys
- creating electronics isn't trivial here...
- somewhat more involved smelting & intermediate assembly
- protecting your factory from the cold, harsh weather
- exploration?
- in-depth logistics
