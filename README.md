# Snowfall
> Crash-landed on an inhospitable frozen moon, you must protect your factory from the elements. With an atmosphere of nitrogen and seas of methane, progressing here will be different than anything you've done before. At least scans of the surface didn't detect any lifeforms...

Snowfall is an overhaul mod for Factorio that is focused on expansive logistics, more involved smelting & intermediate assembly, and exploration & discovery.

**in alpha**, many things are subject to change!  
save files will **not** be backwards-compatable at this point.  
balancing is also... incomplete :)

## general gameplay:
- capturing geothermal steam for mechanical power
- somewhat more involved smelting & intermediate assembly
- creating electronics isn't trivial here...
- protecting your factory from the cold, harsh weather
- exploration of the moon you crashed on, and perhaps beyond...
- complex logistics featuring mini trains, cargo ships, and more

## Mods & compatibility
Snowfall depends on the following fantastic mods:
- [Brass Tacks](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BrassTacks) by [planetfall](https://mods.factorio.com/user/planetfall) - "Adds zinc ore so you can make the best alloy."

- [Lasing Around](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LasingAround) by [planetfall](https://mods.factorio.com/user/planetfall) - "Adds helium and laser-related intermediates, and a side-grade to assembling machines."

- [Mini Trains](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Mini_Trains) by [Klonan](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Klonan) - Smaller trains!
- [Requirement of having lamps is not heavily enforced as they are generally the most useless fixtures. However, distributing high amount of them all over the factory no longer looks like such a pointless exercise, after the night stoped appearing so ridiculously inconsequantial.](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rohlinheatagtmuf_Hdhaotaotfnllsape-atnsasri) by [ouk_ouk](https://mods.factorio.com/user/ouk_ouk) - Adjusts the lighting to feel more cold.

- [Realistic Ores](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RealisticOres) by [ouk_ouk](https://mods.factorio.com/user/ouk_ouk) - Copper, iron, and uranium ore have the colors of real ores.
- [Hatsune Enrichment Process](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/hatsune-enrichment-process) by [MisfitMaid](https://mods.factorio.com/user/MisfitMaid) - look, i promise this is a relevant dependency; it's crucial for some planned stuff
- [Informatron](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/informatron) by [Earendel](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Earendel) - "The helpful information directory and guide to the galaxy."

Compatibility with non-dependency mods will not be implemented at this time; Snowfall is still in alpha!  
Snowfall will almost certainly never be compatible with Factorio: Space Age. Compatibility with expansion features (space travel, quality, spoilage) is also highly unlikely, but may happen at some point to work with other standalone planet mods.
