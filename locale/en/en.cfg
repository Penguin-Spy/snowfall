[snowfall]
error-incompatible-scenario=[img=utility/warning_icon] Freeplay interface or spaceship not found! Snowfall does not support other scenarios.\nDetails: __1__
error-not-new-save=[img=utility/warning_icon] You have loaded a save that was not created with Snowfall active. Please start a new game to play Snowfall.\nMap and resource generation will not be correct, required story elements will not be present, the game may crash, and it may be impossible to progress.
spaceship-title=Spaceship > __1__
mineral-survey-result=Grants knowledge on what can be done with the minerals found on the surface.
technology-failed=__1__ (failed)

lea-intro-1=-- SpaceWare PolymerTM OS boot log (recovery mode) --\nconnection to SpaceWare ExaSUIT established (link type: WiFi 14)
lea-intro-2=warning: 23 devices failed to enumerate!
lea-intro-3=warning: filesystem contains 8,192,486 files with no data but a size greater than 0!
lea-intro-4=initializing system complete
lea-intro-5=[Lea]: ...hello __1__, we appear to have crashed. please give me a moment to analyze our situation.
lea-intro-6=[Lea]: well, the ship isn't spaceworthy, but the arc furnace and computers still work. what's strange though is that my logs and data archives have been completely wiped.
lea-intro-7=[Lea]: i have no memory of how we got here, where here even is, or what these minerals are. and judging from your neural activity, you also have no idea.
lea-intro-8=[Lea]: i suggest you take a sample and place them into the ship's lab so that i can study them. oh and hi! i'm Lea, your autopilot and digital assistant :)

lea-electronics-research-not-working=[Lea]: hm, something is making it difficult for me to create functional integrated circuits here, but i can't tell what; this research might fail.
lea-electronics-research-failed=[Lea]: well i have no idea why, but any IC i make behaves completely erratically. i think we'll have to settle for pneumatic machinery for the moment.
